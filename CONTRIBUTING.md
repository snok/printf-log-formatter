# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome. If you would like to propose
a major change, it's probably a good idea to open an issue to discuss it first,
otherwise a PR is fine.

To submit a PR:

1. Fork the project
2. Make your changes
3. Add tests
4. Open the PR

## Running the project locally

A simple way to test things is to do create
a python file with the syntax you want to test,
then run `cargo run -- <filename>.py` to run the formatter
on it. Once you're happy with your changes you can translate
it to a test input.
